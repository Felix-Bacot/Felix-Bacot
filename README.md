For this journal assignment, I will be submitting a project to my GitHub portfolio as a way to showcase my progress in programming and problem-solving. The portfolio not only highlights my technical skills with C++ and other languages, but also demonstrates my ability to write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code. Along with submitting the project files, I will reflect on the work I completed what I did well, the challenges I faced, and the areas I can improve. This reflection will serve as a valuable reference for future coursework and professional opportunities, while also helping me track my growth as a computer science student.
Project Summary

This repository contains my Corner Grocer project, created for CS210, demonstrating file I/O, frequency counting, and console output formatting in C++.

The purpose of this project was to design a program that analyzes a list of grocery items from a text file and produces frequency counts of each item. The program allows users to search for a specific item’s frequency, view all item frequencies, and generate a histogram for better visualization. This solves the problem of tracking product demand in a clear, organized way that could support a store’s inventory decisions.

Reflection

What did you do particularly well?
I implemented structured file I/O and frequency counting logic in a way that was both reliable and easy to understand. I also made sure the console outputs were formatted neatly so that users could quickly interpret the results.

Where could you enhance your code?
The program could be enhanced with input validation, error handling for edge cases (like empty files or unexpected input), and optimized data structures such as unordered maps for faster lookups. These improvements would make the code more efficient and secure while reducing runtime errors.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?
The most challenging part was ensuring the program correctly parsed the input file and updated item counts without duplication. I overcame this by carefully testing my file reading logic and confirming that the map structure handled key/value pairs properly. Debugging with small test files helped me verify accuracy step by step.

What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I relied on C++ documentation, class examples, and online references like Stack Overflow to troubleshoot issues with file I/O and string handling. These resources are now part of my go-to toolkit when tackling future programming challenges.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
The skills of working with file I/O, frequency counting, and data visualization are widely applicable. I also strengthened my problem-solving process by breaking down requirements into smaller functions, which is highly transferable to any future coding assignments.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I focused on writing clear, modular functions with meaningful names and consistent formatting. I also included inline comments to explain key logic. This makes the program easier to maintain, extend, and adapt for new requirements (such as reading different file formats or adding more analysis options).
